# Travel Game

A refreshed Vite + React dashboard for planning playful world adventures. The interface bundles a destination picker, a running travel log, and a collaborative chat panel.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server
- `npm run build` – produce a production build in `dist`
- `npm run preview` – preview the built app locally

## Features

- 🎯 **Destination planner** – browse curated cities and highlight the current itinerary
- 🧭 **Travel log** – track visited locations, rename your traveler, and see the souvenir shelf grow
- 💬 **Terminal chat** – share plans with your crew (messages persist for the current session)
- 🌗 **Polished visuals** – glassmorphism-inspired styling with responsive layouts down to mobile widths

The codebase is organized into small, typed components under `src/` for easier maintenance and extension.
